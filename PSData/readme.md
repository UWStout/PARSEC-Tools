# PS Data Library
This is a Qt/C++ based library designed to parse and represent a PhotoScan project. It is capable of reading most of the information
available in a PSX archive or the newer project and data folder format. It is used extensively by the PhotoScan Helper application but
is designed to just generally be a back-end component for reading these projects.
