# PARSEC-Tools
A collection of libraries and software for organizing images and processing them to reconstruct a mesh via photogrammetry. These
tools are in support of the PARSEC project (Photogrammetry and Reflectance field Scanner for Education in the Chippewa valley)
funded by an NSF Major Research Instrumentation grant and release of this software as free and open source is in partial fulfillment
of the terms of that grant.

## Status
This software is currently in active development by Seth Berrier at the University of Wisconsin Stout with the help of undergraduate
students. It has not yet reached a stable first release or even 'alpha' state and as such, we are not yet seeking outside help. If
you would like to test the software on your own system we are happy to help you build it but cannot offer much support at this time
for those who do not know how to work with C++/Qt based source code.

Please stay tuned for updates and more documentation and support in the comming year!
